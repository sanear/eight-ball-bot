# Sardonic Eight Ball Webservice and Twitter Bot #

## Possibly the dumbest project you've ever used ##

Run this project to begin searching the twitterstream for yes/no questions and replying sardonically.

Issue a GET request where you're running it to ask the Sardonic Eight Ball a question.

The current incarnation of the eightBallBot is on Twitter @sardonic_8ball, and so far no one has threatened to murder him.
