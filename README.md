# Sardonic Eight Ball Webservice and Twitter Bot #

## Possibly the dumbest project you've ever used ##

Run this project to begin searching the twitterstream for yes/no questions and replying sardonically.

Issue a GET request where you're running it to ask the Sardonic Eight Ball a question.

I should mention that this bot violates Twitter's ToS and only ran for about 24 hours before its key was revoked.
